\chapter{Conclusion}
The goal of the thesis was to increase MAV flight security by assisting the pilot during the navigation, and on the same time to have only a small energy consumption, to be lightweight and easily adaptable to other platform. We were able to prove the feasibility of our approach using four IR ranging sensors. The MAV autonomously hindered the pilot to fly into a wall, and repelled itself, therefore we have successfully increased the security of the MAV. By using the pixhawk we are also able to implement our system onto various platform without many adjustments. In terms of weight and can our system still be improved. The prototype we tested can be miniaturized by using the PCB part of the ranging sensors and the use of a smaller 3D printed case. The use of the mbed microcontroller further increased the size and the energy consumption of the system but is necessary for the calibration and initialisation of the sensors.\\
To conclude, we proved the concept of autonomous obstacle avoidance using small and low power ToF ranging sensors, however, our system is only a first prototype and requires further improvement.\\
