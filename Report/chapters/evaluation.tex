\section{Time-of-Flight Ranging Sensor}
For this thesis we've decided on using the VL53L0X ToF Ranging Sensor developed by STMicroelectronics for the distance measurements. The sensor has a range of 0\unit{mm} up to 2\unit{m} under optimal conditions, i.e. no infrared radiation. The sensor allows four different profile to be used:\\
