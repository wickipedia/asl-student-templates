In the following I present my Bachelor thesis \textit{Assisted Navigation using Time of Flight Ranging Sensors for MAVs} with the overall goal to increase security for MAV flights. The thesis allowed me gain knowledge and discover a new interesting area.\\

I would like to thank my two supervisors Mina Kamel and Rik B\"ahnemann for their valuable support, which was an absolute 
necessity for the accomplishment of this study. Further, I like to thank Prof. Dr. Roland Siegwart who provided me with the opportunity to do my Bachelor thesis in his lab. I also like to thank Dr. Zachary Taylor for testing the platform and Michael Riner-Kuhn for the advices during the assembly of the system. \\

I hope you enjoy your reading\\
