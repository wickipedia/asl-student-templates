\chapter{Methods}
\label{ch:methods}
We've decided on the following approach for the assisted navigation. We use four different ToF ranging sensors each mounted on one side and pointing in either negative or positive x-direction, or in either negative or positive y-direction (\cref{fig:sketch}). These sensors send the ranging data to the \textit{pixhawk} autopilot, in which, w.t.h. of a potential field, the repulsive force is computed. The force is converted into corrective attitude angles and send to the attitude controller (\cref{fig:approach}). Eventually, the drone should push itself away from the obstacle.\\\\

The overall methodology of the thesis can be split into the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Evaluation of the \textit{VL53L0X} ToF Ranging Sensor with a \textit{mbed LPC1768} microcontroller on its potential use for obstacle avoidance on a MAV (\cref{sec:ranging sensor})
	\item Integration of four \textit{VL53L0X} sensors on the pixhawk autopilot (\cref{sec:pixhawk}).
	\item Implementation of a potential field on the \textit{pixhawk} (\cref{sec:potential field}).
	\item Testing of the whole system. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ranging Sensor}
\label{sec:ranging sensor}
A major constraint for MAVs is the payload and the available power, thus, we needed a low power and on the same time lightweight ranging sensor. We've opted for the \textit{VL53L0X} ToF Ranging Sensor developed by \textit{STMicroelectronics} (\cref{fig:sensor}) for the distance measurements. For the evaluation we connected the sensor via I2C to a \textit{mbed LPC1768} microcontroller. The sensor has a range of \unit[0]{mm} up to \unit[2]{m} under optimal conditions, i.e. no infrared radiation. With a IR source the sensor has a range of \unit[0]{m} to \unit[1.2]{m}.  The sensor allows four different modes to be used (\cref{tab:profile}). To facilitate the integration we use the \textit{53L0-SATEL-I1} satellite board (\cref{fig:satellite}). As defined the manufacturer, the satellite board can be used with a power supply ranging from \unit[2.8]{V} up to \unit[5]{V}. The PCB section supporting the VL53L0X module is perforated so that developers can break off the mini PCB for use in a 2.8V supply application. The PCB can be utilized for further minituarisation. The \textit{VL53L0X} sensor comes with a Application Programming Interface (API) which allows to control of the VL53L0X Firmware like initialisation/calibration, ranging Start/Stop, choice of accuracy and choice of ranging mode. If the sensor is not able to make a measurement or the target is outside of its range, the API returns a value greater than 8000.\\

We evaluated the sensor's performance using different target surfaces and under different lightning conditions. During the measurements we varied the angles and distance relative to the target. For the ground truth measurement we used a yardstick and a protractor. We conducted 100 measurements for every measurement setup. The surfaces used for the evaluation were a white plastered wall, a concrete wall and a wooden wall (\cref{fig:surfaces}).\\
The sensor uses IR for the measurement. Another strong IR source in the proximity of the sensor, e.g. the sun, reduces the accuracy and might even obstruct the sensor from making a measurement. To get reliable data, first, we filtered out the failed measurements, i.e., removing all data points with a value greater than 8000, and, second, rejected outliers w.t.h. of the Mahalonobis distance and filtered the remaining data points with a Kalman filter (\cref{alg:filter}). For the filter, we assumed constant distance in the process model:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:filter}
\begin{split} 
x_k & = x_{k-1} \\
y_k & = x_k + v_k
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The noise process $v_k$ is white, zero-mean, uncorrelated, and has known covariance matrix  $R_k$.\\
The assumption of constant distance is only valid for the evaluation of the sensor. In case of a moving sensor or target a dynamic process model has to be developed. Further, a IMU should be used for the a priori state estimate. The VL53L0X sensor fused with a IMU has a faster update rate and performs more accurate. \\

\section{Pixhawk}
\label{sec:pixhawk}
We use a \textit{pixhawk mRo} as a autopilot which has the benefit of being versatile. Thus, our avoidance system is not only applicable to the platform we've used for testing, moreover, the avoidance system can be applied to all platforms using a \textit{pixhawk} autopilot.\\
To couple the \textit{VL53L0X} sensors with the \textit{pixhawk}, first, we tried to connect four different VL53L0X sensors to the pixhawk via I2C. Compiling the firmware on the pixhawk resulted in a flash overflow due to the large sensor API. The API is essential for the initialization and calibration of the VL53L0X sensors. To circumvent this problem, we connect the four sensors to the previously used mbed LPC1768 microcontroller and send the data from the \textit{mbed} microcontroller to the \textit{pixhawk} via I2C. Therewith, we can compile the API on the \textit{mbed} microcontroller and on the \textit{pixhawk} we just have to read the data. The repulsive force of a target is then computed on the pixhawk w.t.h. of a potential field.


\section{Potential Field}
\label{sec:potential field}
The basic idea behind all potential field approaches is that the robot is attracted toward the goal, while being repulsed by the obstacles. For our system, we're only interested in the repulsive potential $U_{rep}$. This potential should be very strong when the system is close to a obstacle and on the same time should not be influenced by obstacle far away. One example of such a repulsive field is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pot field}
\centering
U_{rep}(q)=\begin{cases}
\dfrac{1}{2}k_{rep}\left(\dfrac{1}{\rho (q)}-\dfrac{1}{\rho_0}\right)^2 & \text{if } \rho(q)\leq\rho_0 \\
0 & \text{if } \rho(q)\geq\rho_0 \text{ ,}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $k_{rep}$ is a scaling factor, $\rho(q)$ is the minimal distance from to the object to the system position $q$ and $\rho_0$ is the distance of influence of the object. The repulsive potential function is positive or zero and tends to infinity as $q$ gets closer to the object.\\
If the object boundary is convex and piecewise differentiable, $\rho(q)$ is differentiable everywhere in the free configuration space. This leads to the repulsive force $F_{rep}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:force}
\begin{split}
F_{rep} &=-\Delta U_{rep}(q)\\
&=	\begin{cases}
k_{rep}\left(\dfrac{1}{\rho(q)}-\dfrac{1}{\rho_0}\right)\dfrac{1}{\rho^2(q)}\dfrac{q-q_{obstacle}}{\rho(q)} & \text{if }\rho(q)\leq\rho_0\\
0 & \text{if }\rho(q)\geq\rho_0
\end{cases}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This repulsive force has now to be converted into corrective attitude angles with a further factor $k_{att}$. This yields: 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:angles}
	\Omega_{corr} =\begin{pmatrix}
	\theta_{corr} \\ \phi_{corr} \\ \psi_{corr}
	\end{pmatrix} = k_{att}\cdot F_{rep} \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{corr} \text{, } \phi_{corr} \text{ and } \psi_{corr}$ are the corrective pitch, roll and yaw angles, respectively. In our approach, two ranging sensor measure the distance to a obstacle in x-direction  ($d_{+x}$ \& $d_{-x}$) and two sensor measure the distance to a obstacle in y-direction ($d_{+y}$ \& $d_{-y}$). The idea is that $d_{+x}$ and $d_{-x}$ are used to compute the corrective pitch angle $\theta_{corr}$ and $d_{+y}$ and $d_{-y}$ are used to computed the corrective roll angle $\phi_{corr}$. The corrective roll angle $\psi_{corr}$ is set to zero:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:angle sp}
	\Omega_{corr} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
	\theta_{corr} \\ \phi_{corr} \\ \psi_{corr}
	\end{pmatrix} =
	k_{corr}\cdot 
	\begin{pmatrix}
	\left(\dfrac{1}{d_{-x}}-\dfrac{1}{\rho_0}\right)\dfrac{1}{d_{-x}^2}-\left(\dfrac{1}{d_{+x}}-\dfrac{1}{\rho_0}\right)\dfrac{1}{d_{+x}^2}\\\\
	\left(\dfrac{1}{d_{-y}}-\dfrac{1}{\rho_0}\right)\dfrac{1}{d_{-y}^2}-\left(\dfrac{1}{d_{+y}}-\dfrac{1}{\rho_0}\right)\dfrac{1}{d_{+y}^2} \\\\
	0
	\end{pmatrix}
	\text{ ,}
\end{equation}

where $k_{corr}=k_{att}\cdot k_{rep}$. These corrective angle (\cref{eq:angle sp}) are directly sent to the attitude controller and added to current attitude set-points $\Omega_{sp}$

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:new sp}
	\Omega_{sp}' = \Omega_{sp} + \Omega_{corr} \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_{sp}'$ are the new set-point. \\
To validate \cref{eq:angle sp} we have used Matlab. We have included a upper threshold value for the corrective angle (\cref{fig:pf matlab}). The potential field behaves as desired. The corrective angle increases exponentially with a smaller distance to the wall.

	\label{fig:pf matlab}
\end{figure}


\section{Testing}
For the testing of the whole avoidance system we have used a quadrocopter platform based on the DJI 450 Flame Wheel frame (\cref{fig:loon}). To validate the performance of the implemented potential field we detached the propellers and approached a wall while holding the platform by hand and observed how the motors respond and logged the data. Next, we mounted the propellers and again approached a wall holding the platform. Last, we controlled the platform w.t.h. of a remote control and approached the wall and logged the potential field behaviour.
